# Neural Network from Scratch
My aim was to get a better understanding of the inner workings of a Neural Network and implement a model with practical performance. The neural network is built using **python** and
the only dependency of the model is *numpy* for faster calculations. 

The functions are designed to replicate *Keras* syntax to provide familiarity during usage. The only activation function availabe currently is sigmoid but more
activation functions can be added to the model.

The dataset I used is evaluate the neural network is the "Banknote authentication dataset" which can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication).
The model could predict if a banknote was authentic or not with an accuracy of **97%**.
